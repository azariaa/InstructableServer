Let's start by sending a dummy email to your-self, set the subject to hello and the body to test.
I see that there is no email being composed.
Do you want to compose a new email?

Composing new email. "outgoing email" fields are: subject, body, recipient list and copy list.
The "subject" field in "outgoing email" was set to: "hello".
The "body" field in "outgoing email" was set to: "test".
I see that the message has no recipient.

Sorry, but "myself" is not an email address.
Would you like to teach me what to do in this case (either say yes or simply ignore this question)?
The "recipient list" field in "outgoing email" was set to: "myself@myjob.com".
Email sent successfully.
